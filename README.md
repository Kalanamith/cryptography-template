# Cryptography Operations Module

This Rust module provides cryptographic operations for signing, verifying, and converting data using various cryptographic algorithms. It includes traits and implementations for handling serialization, ECDSA signatures, and more.

## Features

- Conversion of types to bytes and bytes to types using the `ByteOps` trait.
- ECDSA signature verification and signing using the `SecpVRF` trait.
- KeySpace structure for managing public and private keys.

## Usage

1. Add the necessary dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   anyhow = "1.0"
   bincode = "1.3"
   k256 = "0.10"
   secp256k1 = "0.31"
   ethers = "0.15"
   serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
