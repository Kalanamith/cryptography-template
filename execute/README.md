# Cryptography Template

```markdown
This Rust application demonstrates cryptographic operations using the secp256k1 library. It generates key pairs, signs and verifies messages, and computes Ethereum-like addresses from public keys.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, you can install them using Rust's official tool, rustup: [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)

2. Clone or download this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptography-template.git
   cd cryptography-template
   ```

3. Build and Run the Application:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. Output:

   The application will output information about generated key pairs, signatures, and verification results.

## Code Explanation

The application demonstrates the following operations:

- Generating a new key pair using the `KeySpace` struct from the `template::secp` module.
- Converting keys to different formats, such as hex strings and byte arrays.
- Signing and verifying a message using secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.
- Computing Ethereum-like addresses from public keys.

The `Payload` struct is used to create a sample message for signing and verification.

## Dependencies

- `secp256k1`: A library for secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.
- `serde`: A serialization and deserialization library.
- `hex`: A library for working with hexadecimal strings.
